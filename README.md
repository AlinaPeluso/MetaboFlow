# MetaboFlow
This pipeline describes the processing and the analysis of Ionomics data. This [paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.14191) describes a possible application.

The workflow consist of four sections, and respectively

* Pre-processing,
* Exploratory analysis,
* Clustering which also includes the GO Slim annotation and GO terms enrichment,
* Network analysis.

The pre-processing section is required as first as it produces the cleaned dataset used in the other sections. There is no specific order on how to run the other three sections.
